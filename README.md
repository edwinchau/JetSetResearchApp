# JetSet Research App

Travelling across many time zones can be troublesome for people because of jet lag. Along with the aging population who experience the impacts of jet lag more severely, and the introduction of 20hr no-stop-over flights, jet lag is an issue of increasing important for airline companies. In order to understand jet lag better, more research into its impact on travellers is needed. This is the aim of JetSet, a research study application which collects data to help travellers adapt faster to new time zone. Based on current research, jet lag can be potentially influenced by some factors, including but not limited to peopleâ€™s meal time, caffeine intake, sleep time and level of exercise. This data will be collected from JetSet participant via surveys. The JetSet app has been designed in collaboration with the University of Sydney CPC sleep researchers in order to allow them greater insight into the way factors can impact the severity of jet lag.

As it currently stands, the survey process for sleep research is inconvenient and inefficient for the participant to complete, as the survey is a physical pen and paper questionnaire. Likewise, this also puts a burden on the researcher who has to manually input data, which is tedious and tiresome. Therefore, JetSet benefits both participants and researchers by automating the collection, storing and sharing of data through a mobile application.

The JetSet application provides a uniform interface for participants and researchers, where participants are able to finish the surveys fluently and efficiently, and the data will be recorded accurately whilst researchers can easily export the data into the format they want for later analysis. This application is currently iOS only for early versions, but is able to support multiple platforms if desired later on.
